# Advanced View Bot: Proxy & Cloudflare Bypass
 üöÄ Advanced View Bot is a powerful Python-based tool designed to simulate realistic website visits using proxies, browser fingerprints, and advanced techniques to bypass Cloudflare protection. This bot is perfect for testing, analytics, or other legitimate use cases where simulating human-like traffic is required.  Key Features: üåê Proxy Support: Works with HTTP/HTTPS proxies. Automatically tests and filters working proxies.  üõ°Ô∏è Cloudflare Bypass: Utilizes cloudscraper and selenium to bypass Cloudflare's anti-bot protection.  üñ•Ô∏è Realistic Browser Simulation: Simulates human-like browsing behavior with randomized:  User agents  Referrers  Scroll and click events  Viewing times  üß† Browser Fingerprints: Generates and uses realistic browser fingerprints to avoid detection.  ‚ö° Multi-Threading: Supports concurrent requests for faster performance.  üìä Progress Tracking: Tracks successful and failed requests in real-time.  Use Cases: Testing website analytics and tracking systems.  Simulating traffic for load testing.  Educational purposes to understand bot detection mechanisms.  How It Works: The bot loads a list of proxies (optional) and tests them to find working ones.  It generates realistic browser fingerprints to simulate unique users.  Using multi-threading, it sends requests to the target URL while bypassing Cloudflare protection.  It simulates human-like behavior by scrolling, clicking, and spending random amounts of time on the page.  Requirements: Python 3.7+  Libraries: requests, beautifulsoup4, cloudscraper, selenium  Installation: Clone the repository:  bash Copy git clone https://github.com/yourusername/advanced-view-bot.git Install dependencies:  bash Copy pip install -r requirements.txt Run the bot:  bash Copy python main.py Disclaimer: This tool is intended for educational and legitimate purposes only.
